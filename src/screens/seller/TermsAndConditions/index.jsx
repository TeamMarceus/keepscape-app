In the event of a legal dispute, arbitrators will look at the terms and conditions to determine whether each party acted within their rights1. Users typically agree to the terms and conditions by checking a box or clicking a button4.

Terms and conditions agreements are also known as terms of service or terms of use agreements and are often abbreviated as TOS or TOU and T&C or TnC, respectively.
